# Transfer-Learning

Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model trained on one task is re-purposed on a second related task. In the context of image classification, transfer learning involves using a pre-trained model on a large dataset, such as ImageNet, and fine-tuning it on a smaller dataset for a specific image classification task.

There are several benefits to using transfer learning for image classification:

1.It can save time and resources: It is often more efficient to fine-tune a pre-trained model than to train a model from scratch on a small dataset.

2.It can improve performance: Pre-trained models have already learned useful features from a large dataset, which can be useful for the new task.

To use transfer learning for image classification, you will need a dataset of images with labels for the specific task you are interested in. You will also need to choose a pre-trained model to use as the starting point for your fine-tuning. There are many pre-trained models available, such as VGG, ResNet, and Inception, that have been trained on the ImageNet dataset and can be used for transfer learning. Once you have a pre-trained model and your dataset, you can fine-tune the model on your dataset using a process called "transfer learning". This involves unfreezing some of the layers in the pre-trained model and training these layers on your dataset, while keeping the rest of the layers frozen. This allows the model to learn task-specific features while still retaining the general knowledge it has learned from the large dataset.
